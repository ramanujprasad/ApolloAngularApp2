# Simple-apollo-angular-application

The Apollo Client project is part of Apollo and lets us bind GraphQL data to the web user interface. Apollo client is available for major JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular. In this tutorial we’ll take a look at Apollo Client for Angular. We’ll set up a new Angular 5 project from scratch and we’ll learn how to install and make use of Apollo Client to retrieve data from a GraphQL server endpoint and then display those data in your Angular web application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
